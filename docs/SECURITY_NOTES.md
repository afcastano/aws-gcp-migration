## Security note
There are few security considerations on this project:
- This project uses plain text passwords and secrets intentionally to facilitate the demo.
- The IAM roles for the terraform service account are very broad.
- The VMs have password authentication enabled for ssh. Public key authentication is preferred over password auth.
